This page contains instructions about installing the pidgin-logviewer plugin.


= Instructions =

  * Copy the logplugin.so file to ~/.purple/plugins, where ~ usually stands for /home/username
  * If the above path does not exist, you can create it.
  * Optionally, if you have administrator privileges, you may copy to /usr/lib/pidgin
  * Restart pidgin
  * From Tools > Plugins, turn on *Log Viewer* (_not Log Reader_).
  * Now to see the log viewer dialog, go to Tools > Log Viewer > View Logs.
